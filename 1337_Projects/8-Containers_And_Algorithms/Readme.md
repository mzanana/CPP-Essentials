+ **Containers :** Hold and organize data;  
+ **Iterators :** Helps walking through the data in containers one by one;  
+ **Algorithms :** Perform actions like sorting or searching on the data in containers.  

## Benefits of STL
There are many benefits of the STL in c++, for example :  
+ Save time and effort;  
+ Fast and efficient;  
+ Reusability.
