# What you'll learn on CPP00
## Namespaces
The problem that namespaces solve is that in C language if two libraries have a function with the same name its gonna be a conflict. 
That why namespaces comes into c++, think of it like the last name, two persons can be named as `mohamed` in same cluster, but the first one is `zanana mohamed` and the other one `bakir mohamed`.  
### Declaration of namespace :
```CPP
namespace Name
{
	/*  variables, functions
		classes, structs
		(namespace can contain almost any kind of declaration)
	*/
}
```

Another example to visualize the namespaces more you can think of it like a folder, same file name can exist in two different folders without any error.
